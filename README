== About the project ==

This project is part of the free/open-source platform for developing rule-based
machine translation systems, Apertium. And it is being developed as part of the
Google Summer of Code 2011.

The aim of the project is to create a simple compiler and VM for the transfer 
files of Apertium.

== Requirements ==

 - libxml2 (same used by Apertium, you may have it already installed).
 - lttoolbox (again also used by Apertium).
